About mkstrongpw
----------------
mkstrongpw is a Python script which can generate strong passwords.
It has a built-in character sequence generator based on four character
categories: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerical digits, and
non-alphanumeric symbols. Users can configure the likelihood of each
character category in the sequence. Users can also specify their own
character sequence.
