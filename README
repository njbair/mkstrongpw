mkstrongpw is a Python script which can generate strong passwords. It has a built-in character sequence generator based on four character categories: lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numerical digits, and non-alphanumeric symbols. Users can configure the likelihood of each character category in the sequence. Users can also specify their own character sequence.
